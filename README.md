# AI-Native Data Mart Pipeline

This project demonstrates a mini analytics engineering pipeline built with:

- Synthetic event data generation
- Python batch orchestration
- DuckDB-based data mart modeling
- Automated data quality validation
- Superset BI dashboard integration

## Architecture

Synthetic CSV
→ Python Runner
→ DuckDB (Raw + Mart)
